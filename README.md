# Stellar Classification ML Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying stars based on the Stellar Classification Dataset from SDSS17. The dataset provides various features extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), including photometric and spectral information, to classify stars into different classes.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Stellar Classification Dataset - SDSS17
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17)
- **Description:** The data consists of 100,000 observations of space taken by the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey). Every observation is described by 17 feature columns and 1 class column which identifies it to be either a star, galaxy or quasar.
- **Features:**
  - Magnitudes in various photometric bands (u, g, r, i, z)
  - Color indices
  - Spectral features
- **Target Variable:**
  - Class: The classification of stars into different categories based on their properties.
